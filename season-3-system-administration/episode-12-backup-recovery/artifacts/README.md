## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare Test Environment

```bash
# Create test data directory
mkdir -p /home/student/data

# Create some test files
cd /home/student/data
for i in {1..50}; do
    echo "Sample data file $i - $(date)" > file$i.txt
done

# Create subdirectories
mkdir -p /home/student/data/{docs,images,logs}
echo "Important document" > /home/student/data/docs/important.txt
echo "Log entry" > /home/student/data/logs/app.log

# Set proper permissions
chmod 755 /home/student/data
chmod 644 /home/student/data/*.txt
```

### 2. Create Backup Directories

```bash
# Create backup structure
sudo mkdir -p /backup/{full,incremental,offsite}
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /backup
```

### 3. Generate SSH Key (for offsite backup)

```bash
# Generate key for remote backup
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/backup_key -N "" -C "backup@$(hostname)"

# If you have remote server, copy key:
# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/backup_key.pub backup@remote-server
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Tasks

### Task 1: Full Backup Test

```bash
# Run starter.sh
./starter.sh

# Choose option 1 (Full backup)
# Verify:
ls -lh /backup/full/

# Check backup content:
tar -tzf /backup/full/backup-full-*.tar.gz | head -20
```

**Expected result:**
- Backup file created in `/backup/full/`
- `.sha256` checksum file created
- Log entry in `/var/log/backup.log`

---

### Task 2: Incremental Backup Test

```bash
# Add new files to test data
echo "New data" > /home/student/data/new-file.txt

# Run incremental backup
./starter.sh
# Choose option 2

# Verify:
ls -lh /backup/incremental/

# Check with rsync dry-run to see differences:
rsync -avin /home/student/data/ /backup/incremental/incremental-latest/
```

**Expected result:**
- New incremental backup directory created
- Only changed files copied (hard links for unchanged)
- Disk space saved compared to full backup

---

### Task 3: Offsite Backup Test

**Note:** Requires remote server or simulate with local directory.

```bash
# Simulate remote with local directory:
sudo mkdir -p /backup/remote
sudo chown $USER:$USER /backup/remote

# Modify script to use local "remote":
REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH="/backup/remote"

# Run offsite backup
./starter.sh
# Choose option 3
```

---

### Task 4: Restore Test

```bash
# Identify backup file
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t /backup/full/backup-full-*.tar.gz | head -1)

# Restore to test directory
./starter.sh
# Choose option 4
# Enter backup file path and restore directory

# Verify restored data:
ls -lh /tmp/restore/
diff -r /home/student/data /tmp/restore/home/student/data
```

**Expected result:**
- Checksum verified
- Data extracted to restore directory
- All files present and identical to source

---

### Task 5: Health Check Test

```bash
# Run health check
./starter.sh
# Choose option 5

# Expected output:
# - Latest backup age (< 48 hours = OK)
# - Backup size
# - Health status (OK/WARNING/CRITICAL)
```

---

### Task 6: Cleanup Old Backups Test

```bash
# Create old backup (simulate with timestamp manipulation)
touch -d "40 days ago" /backup/full/old-backup.tar.gz

# Run cleanup
./starter.sh
# Choose option 6

# Verify:
ls -lh /backup/full/
# old-backup.tar.gz should be deleted
```

---

### Task 7: Disaster Recovery Test

**This is the big one! Tests complete backup/restore cycle.**

```bash
# Run disaster recovery test
./starter.sh
# Choose option 7

# This will:
# 1. Create 100 test files
# 2. Generate checksums
# 3. Backup files
# 4. DELETE all files (simulate disaster)
# 5. Restore from backup
# 6. Verify checksums
# 7. Cleanup

# Expected: All steps succeed, checksums match
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì Created 100 test files
‚úì Backup created
‚úó Data destroyed!
‚úì Data restored
‚úì All checksums verified! Data integrity confirmed!
DISASTER RECOVERY TEST: SUCCESSFUL ‚úì
```

---

### Task 8: Generate Report Test

```bash
# Run report generation
./starter.sh
# Choose option 8

# View report
cat /tmp/backup-report-*.txt
```

**Expected report sections:**
- Header with date/time
- Full backups list
- Incremental backups list
- Storage usage
- Backup health check
- System info

## üß™ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Krylov Attack Simulation

Recreate the disaster from Episode 12 plot:

```bash
# Day 1: Create production data
mkdir -p /tmp/production/data
echo "Day 1 critical data" > /tmp/production/data/day1.txt

# Full backup
tar -czf /backup/day1-full.tar.gz /tmp/production/data

# Day 2: Add more data
echo "Day 2 additional data" > /tmp/production/data/day2.txt

# Incremental backup
rsync -av /tmp/production/data/ /backup/incremental-day2/

# Day 3: KRYLOV ATTACK! Data corrupted
rm -rf /tmp/production/data/*
echo "HACKED BY KRYLOV" > /tmp/production/data/HACKED.txt

# Discovery: Identify clean backup (day 2)
# Restore:
tar -xzf /backup/day1-full.tar.gz -C /tmp/
rsync -av /backup/incremental-day2/ /tmp/production/data/

# Verify:
ls -lh /tmp/production/data/
# Should have: day1.txt, day2.txt (NOT day3.txt or HACKED.txt)
```

---

### Scenario 2: 3-2-1 Backup Rule Test

Test the complete 3-2-1 rule:

```bash
# 3 copies:
# 1. Original: /home/student/data
# 2. Local backup: /backup/full
# 3. Offsite backup: remote:/backup

# 2 different media:
# - SSD (production)
# - HDD (backup)

# 1 offsite:
# - Remote server

# Verify all copies exist:
ls -lh /home/student/data        # Original
ls -lh /backup/full               # Copy 1
ls -lh /backup/remote             # Copy 2 (offsite)

# Simulate disaster: local disk failure
# You should still have remote backup!
```

---

### Scenario 3: Encryption Test

Add encryption to backups:

```bash
# Generate GPG key
gpg --gen-key

# Encrypted backup
tar -czf - /home/student/data | \
    gpg --encrypt -r your-email@example.com > \
    /backup/encrypted-backup.tar.gz.gpg

# Encrypted restore
gpg --decrypt /backup/encrypted-backup.tar.gz.gpg | \
    tar -xzf - -C /tmp/restore/

# Store GPG key in multiple locations:
# - Password manager
# - Printed on paper in safe
# - USB drive in different location
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Permission denied" when creating backup

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -ld /backup

# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /backup
chmod 755 /backup
```

---

### Problem: "No space left on device"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h /backup

# Clean old backups
find /backup/full -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

# Or move to external storage
rsync -av --remove-source-files /backup/full/ /mnt/external/
```

---

### Problem: Restore fails with "checksum mismatch"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Backup may be corrupted!
# Try previous backup:
PREV_BACKUP=$(ls -t /backup/full/*.tar.gz | sed -n '2p')
tar -xzf "$PREV_BACKUP" -C /tmp/restore/

# If all backups fail ‚Üí check hardware (disk errors?)
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

---

### Problem: rsync incremental backup too slow

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use rsync with compression and bandwidth limit:
rsync -avz --bwlimit=10000 /source/ /backup/

# Or use --inplace for large files:
rsync -av --inplace --no-whole-file /source/ /backup/
```

---

### Problem: SSH offsite backup fails with "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify SSH key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/backup_key backup@remote-server

# Check remote permissions
ssh backup@remote-server "ls -ld ~/backup"

# Re-copy key if needed
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/backup_key backup@remote-server
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

**Typical backup times (1GB data):**

| Method | Time | Size | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| tar.gz | ~30s | 300MB | Best compression |
| rsync (full) | ~15s | 1GB | Fast, no compression |
| rsync (incremental) | ~2s | 50MB | Only changes |

**Storage efficiency (100GB data, 30 days):**

| Strategy | Total Storage | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Daily full | 3TB | 30 √ó 100GB |
| Weekly full + daily incremental | 700GB | 4 √ó 100GB + 26 √ó 10GB |
| Monthly full + daily differential | 1.2TB | Best for most cases |

## üìù Liisa's Final Checklist

Before considering your backup system "production-ready", verify:

- ‚úÖ Automated backups running (cron)
- ‚úÖ Full backup weekly
- ‚úÖ Incremental backup daily
- ‚úÖ Offsite backup exists
- ‚úÖ Restore tested successfully (within last 30 days)
- ‚úÖ Health monitoring active
- ‚úÖ Logs reviewed regularly
- ‚úÖ Retention policy implemented
- ‚úÖ Disaster recovery plan documented
- ‚úÖ Team knows restore procedures

**Liisa's wisdom:**
> *"If you can't test restore in 5 minutes without documentation ‚Äî your backup system is too complex. Keep it simple. Keep it tested."*
